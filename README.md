A small Electron program to display a pomodoro timer to help with productivity.

## Features

Three predefined time intervals:

- Work timer: 25 minutes
- Short break: 5 minutes
- Long break: 15 minutes

No pause functionality due to pausing being against the core principles of the pomodoro technique. 
These intervals are to be treated as continuous blocks, if a real world interruption occurs, reset 
the timer and restart your block.

## How to Pomodoro Technique

To use the pomodoro technique, start the work timer at the beginning of your work session. Ensure
that you focus on your tasks and fight the urge to go off track, this includes checking your email
or making unnecessary web searches.

Once your timer is over, start a break interval where you can do whatever you want, as long as you
do not have a break longer than your allotted time. Finally start another work period and repeat.

## How to Run
